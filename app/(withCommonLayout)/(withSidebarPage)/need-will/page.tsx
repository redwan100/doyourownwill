          <p className="text-pera text-sm sm:text-base">
            Many people put off writing a Will because they believe it will be
            costly or difficult, that it is unnecessary because their
            possessions will automatically pass to their spouse or children, or
            simply to avoid thinking about their own death. But writing a Will
            is critically important for all adults regardless of wealth, marital
            status, or age.

                <p className="text-pera text-sm sm:text-base">
                  If you die without a Will, the law decides how your estate
                  will be distributed. Although some property will automatically
                  be passed to a spouse or children, exact distribution depends
                  on the value of the property and the terms of title deeds. A
                  Will is the only way to ensure that your wishes will be
                  carried out.

                <p className="text-pera text-sm sm:text-base">
                  Writing a Will allows you to decide who will oversee and
                  manage distribution of your estate. Designating a trustworthy
                  and impartial Executor provides peace of mind that the terms
                  of your Will will be honored. See the section on{" "}

                  Your Will serves as the legal guiding document for care of
                  minor children in the event of the death of both parents. See

                  Specifying your funeral wishes in your Will reduces stress for

                  It is generally faster and less costly to settle an estate
                  with a valid Will. Reducing legal fees protects the value of
                  your property and savings to be passed to beneficiaries.

                  A Will that clearly outlines your wishes for funeral
