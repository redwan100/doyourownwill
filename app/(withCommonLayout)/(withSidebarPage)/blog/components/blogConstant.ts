    desc: "When making an estate plan and preparing for the future, most are careful to account for all their assets and personal possessions in their will, but what about your pets? If you’re a pet owner – and you do not include them in your estate planning, your pet may suffer, starve or be destined to a fate that you would never have wanted. Sometimes, and because formal arrangements are not made, a pet owner will merely entrust his animal to a close friend or family member by some informal means. We can all envision how that scenario might play out in the worst of circumstances. Even in the best of those circumstances, the pet's new owner may not be able to keep the pet because of allergies, lack of time, conflict with other pets or a prohibition of pets in the residence. A pet owner's only assurance is to draft legally enforceable documents that will guarantee the pet's future.",

A common scenario applies to a parent who wants to “give the house to the children” for estate planning purposes, but maintains control over the property. The parent transfers the real estate by deed to the children but reserves a life estate for him or herself. In this scenario, the parent becomes the “life tenant,” and the children have what is known as a “remainder interest.”",
