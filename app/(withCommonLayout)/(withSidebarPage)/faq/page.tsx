              Writing a Will is critically important for all adults regardless
              of wealth, marital status, or age. A Will allows you to: ensure
              that your possessions will be distributed as you wish; appoint and
              outline powers of an executor and/or trustee; appoint a guardian
              for minor children; specify funeral wishes; expedite the legal
              process; and reduce stress and heartache for loved ones. See the

            desc="A Living Will is a written declaration in which you state, in advance, your wishes about the use of life-prolonging medical care if you become terminally ill and unable to communicate or a physician has determined that you will not recover from a vegetative state due to brain damage. Usually, you will be in a state that if you do not receive life-sustaining treatment (e.g., intravenous feeding, respirator), you will die. If you do not want to burden your family with the medical expenses and prolonged grief involved in keeping you alive, when there is no reasonable hope of revival, a Living Will typically authorizes withholding or turning off life-sustaining treatment. If your Living Will is properly prepared and clearly states your wishes, the hospital or doctor should abide by it, and will, in turn, be immune from criminal or civil liability for withholding treatment. Some people worry that by making a Living Will, they are authorizing abandonment by the medical system. However, a Living Will can state whatever your wishes are regarding treatment; so even if you prefer to receive all possible treatment, whatever your condition, it is a good idea to state those wishes in a Living Will."

              <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-pera">
                A Living Will can be general or very specific in specifying the
                types of medical treatment you desire if you become
                incapacitated. For example, typical language commonly utilized
                in Living Wills is as follows: "If at any time (a) I am close to
                death and life support would only postpone the moment of my
                death; or (b) I am unconscious and it is very unlikely that I
                will ever become conscious again; or (c) I have a progressive
                illness that will be fatal and the illness is in an advanced
                stage, and I am consistently and permanently unable to
                communicate, swallow food and water safely, care for myself and
                recognize my family and other people, and it is very unlikely
                that my condition will substantially improve; or (d) life
                support would not help my medical condition and would make me
                suffer permanent and severe pain; then, in any such event, I
                direct that life support be withheld and withdrawn and that I be
                permitted to die naturally with only the administration of
                medication or the performance of any medical procedure deemed
                necessary to keep me comfortable and to relieve pain. The
                procedures and treatment to be withheld and withdrawn include,
                without limitation, surgery, antibiotics, cardiac and pulmonary
                resuscitation, and respiratory support. I expressly authorize
                the withholding and withdrawal of artificially provided food,
                water, and other nourishment and fluids."

                A Living Will can also address whether you want to donate tissue
